<h2>Talk Abstracts</h2>

<a name="bocchi"></a>
<h3>Laura Bocchi: <i>From time-sensitive models to time-sensitive programs</i></h3>

<p>I will present recent and ongoing work, based on automata and session
types, towards supporting the verification of real-world
time-sensitive programs. The talk will centre on a theory of
refinements for timed asynchronous systems, in the formal setting of
Communicating Timed Automata. I will introduce three notions of
(compositional and decidable) refinement, serving as a formal
counter-part of concrete implementations with time-sensitive
programming primitives. I will then establish conditions under which
the given refinements preserve the behaviour of systems and their
progress properties. All our results build upon new semantics of CTAs,
that are needed to faithfully model the behaviour of real-time
primitives of mainstream programming languages.</p>

<h3>Gary Brown: <i>Scribble in an Agile Cloud Native World</i></h3>

<p>This talk (and demo) will review how technology has changed
through the life of the ABCD project and will discuss how Scribble
could be used in the future.</p>

<a name="dardha"></a>
<h3>Ornela Dardha: <i>A new linear logic for deadlock-free session-typed processes</i></h3>

<p>The &pi;-calculus, viewed as a core concurrent programming
language, has been used as the target of much research on type systems
for concurrency. We propose a new type system for deadlock-free
session- typed &pi;-calculus processes, by integrating two separate lines
of work. The first is the propositions-as-types approach by Caires and
Pfenning, which provides a linear logic foundation for session types
and guarantees deadlock-freedom by forbidding cyclic process
connections. The second is Kobayashi's approach in which types are
annotated with priorities so that the type system can check whether or
not processes contain genuine cyclic dependencies between
communication operations. We combine these two techniques for the
first time, and define a new and more expressive variant of classical
linear logic with a proof assignment that gives a session type system
with Kobayashi-style priorities. This can be seen in three ways: (i)
as a new linear logic in which cyclic structures can be derived and a
cycle-elimination theorem generalises cut-elimination; (ii) as a
logically- based session type system, which is more expressive than
Caires and Pfenning's; (iii) as a logical foundation for Kobayashi's
system, bringing it into the sphere of the propositions-as-types
paradigm.</p>

<h3>Simon Fowler: <i>Session Types without Tiers</i></h3>

<p>
Session types statically guarantee that concurrent communication
complies with a protocol. However, most accounts of session typing do
not handle failure, which means they are of limited use in distributed
settings where failure is pervasive.</p>

<p>We give the first formal account of session typing with failure
handling in a functional programming language. We define a core
calculus which satisfies preservation and progress properties, is
deadlock free, data-race free, and terminating.</p>

<p>We provide the first implementation of session typing with failure
handling for a fully fledged functional programming language, by
extending the Links web programming language. Our implementation draws
on existing work on algebraic effects and effect handlers. We
illustrate our implementation through a chat server application for
the web, in which all communication occurs over session typed channels
and disconnections are handled gracefully.</p>

<h3>Dimitrios Kouzapas and Laura Voinea: <i>A session type system for asynchronous unreliable broadcast communication</i></h3>

<p>Communication patterns arising in concurrent programming can
benefit from being formally specified. Session types are such formal
specifications, that guarantee desired communication
behaviour. However, up to now, session type systems have assumed that
communication is reliable, without message loss. This excludes a wide
class of distributed systems, where unreliable communication is
common, such as ad-hoc networks or wireless sensor networks. To
address this, we introduce a process calculus with unreliable
broadcast communication, equipped with a sound session type
system. Broadcast and gather operations, common in such networks, are
captured by our asynchronous semantics, in the presence of message
loss. Message loss may lead to unsynchronised session endpoints. To
further account for unreliability we propose a recovery mechanism that
corresponds to real time conditions. Our type system ensures safety
between all synchronised endpoints within a session. We show that
dropping session endpoints, when internal conditions are met, is
safe. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our framework by
implementing Paxos, the textbook protocol for reaching consensus in an
unreliable, asynchronous network.</p>

<h3>Vasco Vasconcelos: <i>Specifying and testing REST application interfaces</i></h3>

<p>REST APIs are nowadays a popular tool to program web
services. The correct development of server and client code requires
well documented interfaces.  Despite initiatives such as the Open API
Specification, the support for the description of such interfaces is
currently quite limited, focusing essentially on syntactic aspects.
We present HeadREST, a language intended to describe the semantic
aspects of REST APIs. We show a testing technique aiming at verifying
the compliance of a REST API against its HeadREST spec. [Joint work
with F&aacute;bio Ferreira, Telmo Santos, Francisco Martins, and Ant&oacute;nia
Lopes]</p>
